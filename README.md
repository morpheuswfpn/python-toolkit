# Info
This is a small Python program or rather a set of programs written in python by me and itz_cubic as a school project.

The Programm consists of a main GUI that can be viewed as kind of a launcher, this GUI contains launch buttons to then execute the modules which are also little GUI's located in `/modules`.

# Installation Linux
On Linux distributions you will quite likely get the error message that packages should not be installed globally and that is where the virtual environment comes into play. Refer to [this](documentation/venv.md) guide and then do the normal installation.

# Installation (windows & mac maybe)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

python ./main.py
```
