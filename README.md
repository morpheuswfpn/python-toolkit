# Info
Simple GUI Program written by me and MIBB as part of a school project, it consists of the main GUI and what we call modules. These modules are other GUI programs that get launched from the main one.

Currently there are following modules:
- Filesorter
- Resource Monitor
- Calculator

The GUI's use the SunValley ttk theme.
# Installation Linux
On Linux distributions you will quite likely get the error message that packages should not be installed globally and that is where the virtual environment comes into play. Refer to [this](documentation/venv.md) guide and then do the normal installation.

# Installation (windows & mac maybe)
## Install dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run
```sh
python ./main.py
```
