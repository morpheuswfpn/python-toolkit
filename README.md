# Info
This is a small Python program or rather a set of programs written in python by me and itz_cubic as a school project.

The Programm consists of a main GUI that can be viewed as kind of a launcher, this GUI contains launch buttons to then execute the modules which are also little GUI's located in `/modules`.
